# <PreWork Study Guide Webpage for Paul Koehler>

## Description

This is a Study Guide Webpage that helps explain some of the basics of the four topics of the Prework study guide: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
I built this project so I could become comfortable coding and also practice the Git flow, which is important for other projects going forward.
It helps solve "imposter syndrome", and while it is a simple project, it is a good way to get used to coding in the future with a variety of other languages.
I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I learned how to take all of this code and use it in a Git flow for help with future projects.

## Installation

## Usage

The webpage is pretty straightforward, with a description of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GIF. Upon opening Chrome Developer Tools, we are able to take a look at various JavaScript commands and functions that are setup for demonstration purposes.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
